.TH CURLOPT_NETRC 3 "January 07, 2022" "libcurl 7.82.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NETRC \- enable use of .netrc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NETRC, long level);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This parameter controls the preference \fIlevel\fP of libcurl between using
user names and passwords from your \fI~/.netrc\fP file, relative to user names
and passwords in the URL supplied with \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP. On Windows,
libcurl will use the file as \fI%HOME%/_netrc\fP, but you can also tell
libcurl a different file name to use with \fICURLOPT_NETRC_FILE(3)\fP.

libcurl uses a user name (and supplied or prompted password) supplied with
\fICURLOPT_USERPWD(3)\fP or \fICURLOPT_USERNAME(3)\fP in preference to any of
the options controlled by this parameter.

Only machine name, user name and password are taken into account (init macros
and similar things are not supported).

libcurl does not verify that the file has the correct properties set (as the
standard Unix ftp client does). It should only be readable by user.

\fIlevel\fP is a long that should be set to one of the values described below.
.IP "CURL_NETRC_IGNORED (0)"
The library will ignore the \fI.netrc\fP file. This is the default.
.IP "CURL_NETRC_OPTIONAL (1)"
The use of the \fI.netrc\fP file is optional, and information in the URL is to
be preferred.  The file will be scanned for the host and user name (to find
the password only) or for the host only, to find the first user name and
password after that \fImachine\fP, which ever information is not specified.
.IP "CURL_NETRC_REQUIRED (2)"
The use of the \fI.netrc\fP file is required, and any credential information
present in the URL is ignored.  The file will be scanned for the host and user
name (to find the password only) or for the host only, to find the first user
name and password after that \fImachine\fP, which ever information is not
specified.
